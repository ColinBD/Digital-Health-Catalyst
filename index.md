We are excited to start the IMPART (**I**nnovative **M**ethods for **P**atient **A**ssessment using **R**eal-world digital **T**echnology) Academy for early career researchers (ECRs) in digital health. This academy will initially be available to ECRs in the IMI2 projects [MobiliseD](https://www.mobilise-d.eu/) and [IDEA-FAST](https://idea-fast.eu/) but we aim to open it to the wider digital medicine community in the future. We are currently still in the early stages, so if you would like to join the organising team, please get in touch [add contact option here]!

# Aim
Our aim is to create a network of ECRs to share experiences and knowledge between each other and strengthen interactions between industry and academia in the field of real-world digital health technologies. We want to help ECRs find opportunities to shape their future careers and develop the needed skillset to succeed both in an academic or industry setting.

# What is an ECR?
ECR is short for “early career researcher”. We want to open the Academy to a wide range of people in academia and industry such as:
*   students (including PhD students)
*   post-docs
*   junior group leaders
*   others

# Content
We are currently in the process of developing the content for the Academy. If you have any suggestions for formats that you would like to attend or organise, please let us know [add contact option here]. Current ideas include:
*   Mobility placement & partnerships
*   Development of smaller public-private partnership projects to tackle current challenges in digital biomarker development
*   Career trajectories and opportunities (i.e., academia, industry, entrepreneurship)
*   Cross-disciplinary education & discussions
*   Research-in-progress presentations
*   Journal club
*   Help forum: Learning from other ECRs' questions and expertise
*   Soft skill and life skill development (i.e., presentations, networking, work-life balance)
*   Technical skills (grant writing, publishing, data analysis, etc.)
*   Mentorship
*   Job listings
